### Projects :
* **1.** Build a web application in Python using the Flask Framework that allows users to upload and download files, and perform basic file management operations such as renaming, moving and deleting files.

* **2.** Implement a web API in Python using Flask that exposes a set of endpoints for performing CRUD ( create, read, update, delete ) operations on a database of records. The API should support HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and use JSON for data serialization and deserialization. The API should also include features such as data validation, error handling and documentation using OpenAPI or Swagger. 

* **3.** Build a web application in Python using the Flask Framework and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow that allows users to upload and classify images. The application should allow users to train a custom image classifier using a set of labeled images, and shoul provide a user-friendly interface for uploading and classifying new images. The application should also include features such as data visualization, data validation and error handling. The application could be used to classify images in a variety of domains, such as medical images or natural images etc.
